In its scope, `onlyInitializing` functions can be\n used to initialize parent contracts.\n A reinitializer may be used after the original initialization step. This is essential to configure modules that\n are added through upgrades and that require initialization.\n When `version` is 1, this modifier is similar to `initializer`, except that functions marked with `reinitializer`\n cannot be nested. If one is invoked in the context of another, execution will revert.\n Note that versions can jump in increments greater than 1; this implies that if multiple reinitializers coexist in\n a contract, executing them in the right order is up to the developer or operator.\n WARNING: setting the version to 255 will prevent any future reinitialization.\n Emits an {Initialized} event."

    "details": "This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \"step\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ``` contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\"MyToken\", \"MTK\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\"MyToken\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```",
