    "details": "An upgradeability mechanism designed for UUPS proxies. The functions included here can perform an upgrade of an {ERC1967Proxy}, when this contract is set as the implementation behind such a proxy. A security mechanism ensures that an upgrade does not turn off upgradeability accidentally, although this risk is reinstated if the upgrade retains upgradeability but removes the security mechanism, e.g. by replacing `UUPSUpgradeable` with a custom implementation of upgrades. The {_authorizeUpgrade} function must be overridden to include access restriction to the upgrade mechanism. _Available since v4.1._",

It is used to validate the implementation's compatibility when performing an upgrade. IMPORTANT: A proxy pointing at a proxiable contract should not be considered proxiable itself, because this risks bricking a proxy that upgrades to it, by delegating to itself until out of gas. Thus it is critical that this function revert if invoked through a proxy. This is guaranteed by the `notDelegated` modifier."
